some codes when learning python
Hi,all
It is my first time to use the github while I had visited others' git in the past
For the motivation, it's just share and improve.Though I have learned codes a few years, I had never put my codes on the websites.
Otherwise, I have learned others' code and  getten their resources.
This summer,2019,I eventually open my github account and ready to get on the way to sharing.
I'm  just looking forward to explore git world

At last, I just wanna say 'Hello, Git!'
